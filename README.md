## Overview

The purpose of this project was to create a webpage, in which users can filter through UFO data by date, city, and more. 

## Results

The created webpage has a simple user interface, allowing users to enter the desired filters to find reported UFO sightings. The user can filter through the database of UFO sightings by date, city, state, country, and even by shape. The website will return all of the UFO sighting results matching the user defined filters.

## Summary

The UFO sightings webpage is a great start to what could be an incredible UFO sighting resource, because it is user-friendly and informative. One drawback of this design is that it currently does not include pictures of the UFO sighting. I think that would be cool to be able to see any available pictures of the reported UFO sighting!
